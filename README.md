# PySide6 - Utils
`pyside6-utils` implements several useful PySide6 widgets, models and delegates as well as some utility functions.
The package contains registrars for these widgets, which can be [used to register the widgets in QtDesigner](#Qt-Designer) to quickly build UI's.

This package was mainly developed around the python Dataclass-functionality and helps to create user-friendly apps to view/edit large configurations (for example training configurations for machine learning). It was developed in tandem with [TODO]. 


A quick list of the main widgets:
- [`DataclassTreeview` (and `DataClassModel` & `DataClassEditorDelegate`)](#DataclassTreeview)
  - A view/model/delegate combination which mirrors a python dataclass (`@dataclass`) object and provides editors for each of the types defined. Edits are propagated to the dataclass object. We can use [`dataclasses.field()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#dataclasses.Field) to customize how attributes are displayed and to change the editor-type and constraints.
- [`PandasTableView` (and `PandasTableModel`)](#PandasTableView)
  - Provide an easy way to show and edit pandas dataframes
- [`CollapsibleGroupBox`](#CollapsibleGroupBox)
  - A groupbox that acts as a layout, when the user check/unchecks the groupbox, the contents collapse
- [`ConsoleWidget`](#ConsoleWidget)
  - A console-like widget to which multiple files can be mirorred, user can select the items to view the consoleitem-contens
- [`ExtendedMdiArea` / `FramelessMdiWindow`](#ExtendedMdiArea)
  - Based on PySide6.QtWidgets.QMdiArea, provides a way to load frameless windows with a custom UI, while also retaining resize/move/etc. A custom UI example is provided in `./ui/FrameslessMdiWindow.ui` 
- [`FileExplorerView`](#FileExplorerView)
  - Built around the use of a QFileSystemModel - enables right-click operations and undo/redo actions, as well as the possibility to set a "highlighted" file
- [`OverlayWidget`](#OverlayWidget)
  - Provides a container-widget to which another widget can be provided, when turning the overlay-mode of this widget on, this widget will be overlayed over the contained widget(s)
- [`SquareFrame`](#SquareFrame)
  - A small widget wrapper that enforces squareness. Useful when designing UI's in QtDesigner.
- [`RangeSelector`](#RangeSelector)
  - Widget to select a range of float/int/datetime, provides extra styling if ticks are provided.


## Installation
The easiest way to install this package is using pip:
```
pip install pyside6-utils
```

The package can also be manually installed by downloading this repository, extracting it to the desired install location and installing it using:
```
pip install <install_path>
```
Optionally, we can provide the `-e` argument so we can edit the package while pip keeps everything up to date.

## Qt-Designer
This package provides registrars for the implemented widgets, which means that the widgets can be made available directly in qt-designer (note that `pyside6-designer` should be used).
To enable this, the environment variable `PYSIDE_DESIGNER_PLUGINS` should be set to `<install_path>/registrars`, so that the widgets can be loaded in using the `QPyDesignerCustomWidgetCollection.registerCustomWidget` method.

Alternatively, we can automatically set environment variables by using the provided pyside6 launch script. We can use this script by running `<install_path>/examples/run_qt_designer.py` or by importing and running the `run_qt_designer()`-function using:
```
from pyside6_utilities.examples import run_qt_designer
```

If all is well, this should result in the widgets showing up in the left-hand side of Qt-designer, e.g. for the views it should look like this:

# Widgets
**NOTE: every widget-module contains a `run_example_app()` function, which starts a qt app and an example-instance of the widget in question, the following example-widget-images are pictures of these examples.**

## `DataclassTreeview`
`DataclassTreeview`, `DataClassModel` and `DataClassEditorDelegate` are a view/model/delegate combination (resp.) which mirror a python dataclass (`@dataclass`) object and provides editors for each of the types defined.

The model is mainly built around the `field()` functionality of dataclasses, which allows the model to make use of the default values, type hints and other information provided by the dataclass.
For each field, we can provide additional information in the `metadata` attribute of `field()`, this information is used by the model to determine the editor/limits to use for the field.
The following metadata is supported:

| Metadata Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `"display_name"` | `str` | Name to display for this attribute in the view - defaults to the variable name itself |
| `"display_path"` | `str` | Path to display this attribute - we can group/structure items when using a treeview - defaults to no parents|
| `"help"` | `str` | Help-message which will be shown when the user hovers over this item - empty by default|
| `"constraints"` | `List[sklearn_param_validation constraints]` | Additional constraints on which the editor will be determined to apply to the field [^constraint_note], if none provided, use typehint of the field|
| `"required"` | `bool` | Whether this field is required to be filled in `TODO`|

[^constraint_note]Constraints are (almost fully) sourced from the `sklearn.utils._validation` module and provides a way to constrain the dataclass fields such that the user can only enter valid values. They are also packed into this package under `utility.constraints`. The following constraints are supported:
| Constraint | Description | Editor Type
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | The type of the value should match the type of the constraint | based on type |
| `Options` / `Container` | The value should be one of the options provided in the constraint | `QComboBox` |
| `StrOptions` | The value should be one of the str-options provided in the constraint | `QComboBox` |
| `Interval` | The value should be within the interval provided in the constraint | `QSpinBox` or `QDoubleSpinBox` (limited) |
| `None` | `None` is a valid value for this field `typing.Optional` | Adds reset-button to editor |
| `Range` | The value should be within the range provided in the constraint | `QSpinBox` (limited) |
| `TODO` | Maybe more? |

Default values are saved and can be reset using right-click context menu. Values that have changed from default will appear in bold.

An example of a dataclass-view is shown below:
<p align="center">
	<img src="https://github.com/Woutah/pyside6-utils/blob/main/pyside6_utils/examples/images/dataclass_view.png?raw=True" width="800" />
</p>

The dataclass from which this example was generated can be found under `./examples/example_dataclass.py`.  

## `PandasTableView` (and `PandasTableModel`)
Provide an easy way to show and edit pandas dataframes. Pandas-table model adds the possibility to copy/paste data from excel, as well as current selection information (e.g. selected cells, average, total and sum).
<p align="center">
	<img src="https://github.com/Woutah/pyside6-utils/blob/main/pyside6_utils/examples/images/pandas_table_view.png?raw=True" width="800" />
</p>



## `ExtendedMdiArea` / `FramelessMdiWindow`
Based on PySide6.QtWidgets.QMdiArea, provides a way to load frameless windows with a custom UI, while also retaining resize/move/etc. The ui used by default is provided in `./ui/FrameslessMdiWindow.ui`.

<p align="center">
	<img src="https://github.com/Woutah/pyside6-utils/blob/main/pyside6_utils/examples/images/extended_mdi_area.png?raw=True" width="800" />
</p>

We can drag, resize and move the windows as we would expect from a normal window. The windows can also be maximized and minimized using the buttons in the top-right corner. A custom UI can be provided, all functionality will be retained if the ui contains the following widgets:

- `contentLayout` (`QtWidgets.QLayout`): The layout that will be used to add the content-widget
- `titleBar` (`QtWidgets.QWidget`): The widget that will be used as the title bar, we can drag the window by using this, the parent-mdi area context menu will also be made available when right-clicking this widget
	- `titleLabel` (`QtWidgets.QLabel`): The label that will be used to display the title
	- `zoomButton` (`QtWidget.QButtton`): If pressed, set window to fullscreen
	- `minimizeButton` (`QtWidget.QButtton`): If pressed, minimize the window



## `CollapsibleGroupBox`
A QtWidgets.QGroupbox that acts as a layout, when the user check/unchecks the groupbox, the contents collapse
When opened:

	<img src="https://github.com/Woutah/pyside6-utils/blob/main/pyside6_utils/examples/images/collapsible_group_box_open.png?raw=True" width="800" />
</p>
When collapsed:

	<img src="https://github.com/Woutah/pyside6-utils/blob/main/pyside6_utils/examples/images/collapsible_group_box_collapsed.png?raw=True" width="800" />
</p>

## `Console Widget`
We can import `console_from_file_item` from `pyside6_utils.models.console_widget_models` to create console items which mirror a text-output file. We can then add these items to the console-widget using `ConsoleWidget.add_item`.

The user can then scroll between the various console-outputs, which are updated every time the target file changes. This is especially useful for managing multiple output-files.
